# Notes-Summarizer Tool

**Research question**

Can machine learning algorithms such as GPT-4V be used to analyse large datasets of student notes to generate master notes for students to use and share to support their learning? 

**Method**
1) Use GPT4 Vision to extract and process text. Tune parameters to enhance reliability and accuracy.
2) Use LLM Models (GPT, Gemini, Claude) as a Q&A Bot with the extracted text as the primary database.
3) Build a Front End User Interface.

**Purpose**
Students prefer writing their notes by hand but due to the speed and style of lecturers, notes are often messy and span several pages. In knowing this, our project is to create a tool that allows students to make a digital form of their notes that makes revision and knowledge recall faster.
As part of I-Explore Interdisciplinary Computing Year 2 Module.
